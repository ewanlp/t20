# Teamwork Questionnaire for _yournamehere_

1. __What is your personality type?__
   ESFJ
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   email and text are the best for me - anytime of the day from:
       7am - 9:30pm (no later than that!)
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   learning to work as a team! This is not easy and I feel that it may be the most valuable skill to draw
   from when looking back on this class.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   keeping my teammates accountable. It's easy to let others slack, or do all the work, while I do all the work or slack.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   differing styles of working on the project: everyone has their own workflow but we **need** to find one that
   works for all of us!
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   have a group meeting, decide what our priorities are and reasons for those priorities, and perhaps reach
   out to a TA or the professor.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   not neccessarily. All team members should be doing work equally, and if someone has the option to do 
   work that would earn an 'A' then they should do it and other team members should hold them accountable.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   Personally: ~5 hours a week or more. As a team, ~17-20 hours or more.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   this will be decided in team meetings. Work will be delegated appropriately.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   they must be held accountable. Whether that means that a team meeting is held about it, a TA is contacted, etc.
   First, though, it's important to understand why they missed the deadline (illness, death in the family, w/e)
   and then action can be taken from there.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   similar to that above, it's important to have a meeting with the team and come to a compromise about what
   what is acceptable. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   similar to above, team meetings and understanding how others function is very important.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   yes, I feel that this would be very beneficial.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   1 - 2 times per week at most, but perhaps this time can be used to team program together.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   depending on the decision being made. If it pertains to a technology being used, a method of communication,
   programming and documentation practiceor something that requires the attention of everyone, then certainly yes. 
   If it is about what a variable should be named, no.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   seek to understand why that group member believes what they believe, and try to come to a compromise.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   have a team meeting and see if the issue can be resolved. If not, reach out to a TA/professor.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__
   again, hold a team meeting and discuss that this is not alright, and reach out to a staff member if changes
   are not made by other group members.
